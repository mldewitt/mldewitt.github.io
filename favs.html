        "In November I wrote a profile about the magic that was Black Girl Genius Week, a week of events, creation, and celebration of Black girlhood. This week-long event was presented by SOLHOT (Saving Our Lives Hear Our Truths) as an anti-conference and represented an opportunity to engage in SOLHOT sessions at middle and high schools in Champaign-Urbana. But more visible was the participation in next-level SOLHOT practices, like collaborating with musical group We Levitate. Our studio session was a sacred space where we left some of ourselves and took something more important with us. When I first wrote about the event I described our musical process like this: “Using sound and lyrics we addressed patriarchy, anti-blackness, sexism, hoe shaming, violence, death, oppression, capitalism, racism, and a range of other issues that Black girls resist. We also utilized this time to embrace freedom, sisterhood, love, light, movement, resilience, and survival.” - Feministing

        "Yet while Wilmore may be somebody’s worst nightmare, he certainly isn’t Comedy Central’s—nor that of regular late-night comedy viewers. His monologues on such subjects as the Koch brothers, vaccinations, Cuba, and the State of the Union address have mostly sounded, but for Wilmore’s winking about the fact of them being spoken by a black man, as if they could have been delivered by Stewart or the 'Daily Show' alum John Oliver, on his HBO show—or, in his own double-secret ironic way, Stephen Colbert. The show’s set has the same red-and-blue hues and shiny surfaces of 'The Daily Show,' and Wilmore sits in front of a map of the world, just like Stewart. Only Wilmore’s map is upside down." - The New Yorker

      “Hi Usher, baby, I don’t care what you think about what I do for a living. I know working as a stripper doesn’t make me a hoe. That you feel the need to make such a clarification speaks volumes about how you see women and how you see what I do for a living. I also don’t care how you feel about my working hours and let me be frank. If I am working until three, I’m not leaving with you, asshole. I’m going home, to my own place that I pay for with my own money, because my knees and my back are killing me. My work is actual work and it is hard on the body. After a shift, I just want to take a long hot bath and then I want to sleep. - Roxane Gay

       "Asian American kids are looking for idols. I know this because I was looking for one too. They say that the -struggle' becomes less intense with every new generation, that kids nowadays will never have to work as hard as our grandparents. But the truth is that, as entertainers, we are still working toward the same goal as Louis Huang—to provide a better life for our children. I don't think a 22-minute Asian American sitcom can singlehandedly solve all race-related issues in 2015, but I'm pretty sure it's a step in the right direction."" - The Muse
